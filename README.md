Ground Tower Defence
=========

Ground Tower Defence is a collaboration project between Dylan Goudie and myself, for the purpose of the second summative in ICS4U. The project was created in Processing, a program for programming in the context of the visual arts. This projects features many different things:

- multiple towers
- multiple enemies
- custom made graphics

This project is yet to be finished, and there are still several minor and major issues. One main issue is that the waves of enemies still does not function properly.
